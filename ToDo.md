Write logic for sectionAllocator, and maybe I guess allott sections for departments as a whole but not students individually and maybe at maximum only two sections for a department (such as for CSE we had S3 and S7)

Make better constraints and better objective functions, and add more constrains or objectives

Ensure all the objects used in all files are being taken by reference, else it wont work

Change everything to snake case

Change functions to classes in each file

Use enum for Male, Female things

Use 'typing' type consistency everywhere 

Add the following:
1) Weights for cpi, gender, department diversty and preferences should be taken as input
2) Slots available for each department and the departments sh9ould be taken as input
3) Project names and number of projects should be taken as input
4) Ideal Group size and valid range of group size should be taken as input
5) Test cases!!
6) Pre commit!!
7) ...To be added....

Doubts:
Sometime when we run python3 main.py the allocated_students_data.json file is not modified although as per code it must be overwritten and modified. But if I run python3 main.py again, then it gets modified, what could be the reason? Something is wrong with json, but what?
